              This Privacy Policy explains how Sliptail (“<strong>Sliptail</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,”

            <p>
              Where applicable, we rely on: (a) <strong>contract</strong> (to provide the Services); (b){" "}
              <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., security, product improvement, anti-fraud); (c){" "}
              <strong>consent</strong> (e.g., marketing cookies/emails where required); and (d){" "}

            </p>

            <h2>6) How we share information</h2>
            <ul>

                <strong>With creators and customers:</strong> We share what is necessary to fulfill purchases and
                requests (e.g., order details, usernames).
              </li>

                be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to this Policy.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7) Cookies & analytics</h2>
            <p>
              We use essential cookies for login, security, and core functionality; and (optionally) analytics cookies
              (e.g., page views, device stats) to improve the product. Where required, we obtain consent for
              non-essential cookies. You can usually manage cookies via your browser settings. If you implement a
              cookie banner/preferences, link it here (e.g., “Cookie Settings”).
            </p>

            <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
            <p>
              We keep personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate business needs
              (e.g., accounting, security, dispute resolution), then delete or anonymize it. Exact retention depends on
              the type of data and applicable laws.
            </p>

            <h2>9) Security</h2>
            <p>
              We employ administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data. No system
              is perfectly secure; you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and
              promptly notifying us of any suspected compromise.
            </p>

            <h2>10) International data transfers</h2>
            <p>
              We may transfer, store, and process information in countries other than where you live. Where required, we
              use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for transfers of personal data.
            </p>

            <h2>11) Your rights</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>EEA/UK:</strong> You can request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, and
                object to processing (including to profiling for direct marketing). Where we rely on consent, you may
                withdraw it at any time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>US (e.g., CA/VA/CO/CT/UT):</strong> Subject to law, you may request access, deletion, correction,
                and opt-out of “sale”/“sharing”/targeted advertising (as defined by state law). We do not sell personal
                information for money. If analytics/ads are considered “sharing,” you may opt out via browser or cookie
                settings. You will not be discriminated against for exercising rights.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To exercise rights, email <a href="mailto:info@sliptail.com">info@sliptail.com</a>. We may need to verify
              your identity and we will respond as required by law. Authorized agents may submit requests where
              permitted, subject to verification.
            </p>

            <h2>12) Children’s privacy</h2>
            <p>
              The Services are not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information
              from them. If you believe a child provided personal information, contact{" "}
              <a href="mailto:info@sliptail.com">info@sliptail.com</a> and we will take appropriate action.
            </p>

            <h2>13) Creator responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              Creators are independent sellers responsible for their own content and compliance (e.g., consumer,
              marketing, tax, and IP laws). Stripe may collect identity and payout information directly from creators
              per Stripe’s terms. If you reuse customer data for purposes beyond fulfilling sales on Sliptail, you
              act as an independent controller and must provide your own privacy disclosures and lawful basis.
            </p>

            <h2>14) Anti-leak & enforcement cooperation</h2>
            <p>
              We may retain and disclose limited transactional data (e.g., purchase timestamps, usernames, IP logs) to
              facilitate creators’ lawful enforcement against unauthorized redistribution, consistent with this Policy
              and applicable law. See also our <Link href="/terms">Terms of Use</Link>.
            </p>

            <h2>15) Communications</h2>
            <p>
              We send transactional emails (e.g., receipts, password resets, access notices). With consent (if
              required), we may send marketing communications; you can opt out via the email footer or by contacting us.
              Note that critical transactional messages will still be sent.
            </p>

            <h2>16) Changes to this Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post the new
              effective date and, where appropriate, notify you via the Services or email. Your continued use after the
              effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.
            </p>
